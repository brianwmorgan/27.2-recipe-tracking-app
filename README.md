## App Features
### Caesar Shift

The Caesar Shift is a type of substitution cipher originally used by Julius Caesar to protect messages of military significance. It relies on taking the alphabet and "shifting" letters to the right or left, based on the typical alphabetic order. For example, if you were to "shift" the alphabet to the left by 3, the letter "A" would become "X", the letter "E" would become "B", et cetera.

When decoding the message, the number the original message was shifted by must be provided so the message can be shifted in the opposite direction.
